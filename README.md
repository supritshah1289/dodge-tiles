# Dodge-tiles Beta Version
#How to play
1. The game starts once the page is refreshed
2. Do not touch the blue box to the green lines coming out of random from sides

#Inspiration
I have learned this game from w3schools.com. W3school helped me go through each pieces like how the score works, creating componenets, moving through canvas, adding images, adding sound to the game. If you would like to learn more about building games using canvas. I definately recommend you to go through their tutorial[!]http://www.w3schools.com/games/default.asp 

Few things I would like to make changes to this game
#Next Version
1. Box will be replaced with car
2. Background with road Image 
3. Roads will have potHoles if the car hit potholes then game ends else keep going
4. Fixing few bugs like the box goes out of range on the sides 
5. Background Images changes based on score eg. every thousand point change backgroud Image
